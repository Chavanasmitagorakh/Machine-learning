## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Help learners understand how ML algorithms work under the hood
- Implement algorithms from scratch and using `scikit-learn`
- Practice with real-world datasets
- Visualize model decisions and results
- Serve as a boilerplate or reference for ML projects

## 🛠 Algorithms Explained

### 1. 🌳 Decision Tree

- **Concept**: Splits data by features into a tree structure to make predictions.
- **Applications**: Loan approval, medical diagnosis, marketing predictions
- **Libraries Used**: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

### 2. 🌲 Random Forest

- **Concept**: Ensemble of decision trees to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy.
- **Applications**: Fraud detection, stock market prediction, sentiment analysis
- **Extra Feature**: Feature importance visualization

### 3. 👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Concept**: Classifies based on the 'k' closest labeled data points.
- **Applications**: Image classification, recommendation engines
- **Feature**: Distance calculation (Euclidean)

### 4. 🔵 K-Means Clustering

- **Concept**: Unsupervised algorithm that groups data into `k` clusters.
- **Applications**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection
- **Feature**: Cluster visualization using different colors

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each algorithm includes one or more of the following metrics:

- ✅ Accuracy
- 🔁 Confusion Matrix
- 📐 Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- 📉 Elbow Method (for K-Means)
- 📊 Visualization of Results (plots)
