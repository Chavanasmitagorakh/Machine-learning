🛠 Algorithms Explained
1. 🌳 Decision Tree

Concept: Splits data by features into a tree structure to make predictions.

Applications: Loan approval, medical diagnosis, marketing predictions

Libraries Used: scikit-learn, matplotlib

2. 🌲 Random Forest

Concept: Ensemble of decision trees to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy.

Applications: Fraud detection, stock market prediction, sentiment analysis

Extra Feature: Feature importance visualization

3. 👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Concept: Classifies based on the 'k' closest labeled data points.

Applications: Image classification, recommendation engines

Feature: Distance calculation (Euclidean)

4. 🔵 K-Means Clustering

Concept: Unsupervised algorithm that groups data into k clusters.

Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

Feature: Cluster visualization using different colors

5. 📈 Linear Regression

Concept: Models the relationship between input features and continuous target using a straight line.

Applications: Predicting prices, trends, and numerical forecasting

Feature: Line of best fit visualization, residual analysis

6. 📊 Logistic Regression

Concept: Used for binary classification by modeling the probability that an instance belongs to a class.

Applications: Email spam detection, disease diagnosis, churn prediction

Feature: Sigmoid function visualization, decision boundary plot

7. 📐 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Concept: Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.

Applications: Face detection, text classification, bioinformatics

Feature: Margin and support vector visualization
